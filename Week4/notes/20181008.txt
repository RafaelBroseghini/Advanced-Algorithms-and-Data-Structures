Blooming Filters:
    - Closest to a machine learning algorithm for a Data Structure.
    Steps:
        - Get value.
        - Hash it a number of times.
            - hahs % num_bits
                - set that index to 1 while others are 0.
        - add extra char to the otiginal value and hash again.
            - hahs %num_bits
        - redo step 2.

    To look up if the value is in the filter, we must know
    what the extra characters were when rehashing. We look up 
    the hashed values and check if it is.
Hashing functions:
    - Hash values have to be evenly distributed.
    - Any two numbers/string that might be close to each other.


Low level with Python:
    - Anything stored in the computer is stored in binary already.

Little Ending format:
    - For biigger numbers we have an ordering where we have to decide
    which of the addresses

Bit operations:
    - bit or (|): if bit is on in either place turn it on in the other.
