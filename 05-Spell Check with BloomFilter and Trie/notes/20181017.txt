Trie:
    - root: 
        - attr: value, follows, next

    - insert "Cat": the key has to be something we break apart into units.
        - "c"->"a"-"t"->"$"

    - Dollar sign represents the end of the line.

    - inserting "cow":
        - "o" follows the "a"

    - inserting: 
        - recursive: one ket at a time, base case is when the key is empty.
        two parameters, key and node we are trying to insert it in.

        - if first part of the key matches the node we call insert on the follows
        with slice of the key.

        - if does not match insert the rest of key into the next.

        - before you recursively add it, you add the dollar sign at the end of key
            - cow becomes cow$
        
        - return root of the trie after inserting the value.

        - if inserting the empty string return None.

        - add dollar sign when inserting and lookup
            - after inserting batman we check if batman is there and it is. but according to
              our trie.
        
        - next is next word.
        - follows is next character.
