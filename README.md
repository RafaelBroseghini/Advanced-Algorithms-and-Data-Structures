# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures :evergreen_tree:

## Overview:
This repo is a collection of exercises/problems using implementation from scratch of well know data structures and algorithms. It is pretty awesome to implement these data types from scratch and analyze their computational complexity of iteration, lookup, removal, etc. In this sense, pondering trade-offs between time and space has also been a key part in the my designing process.

## Data Structures:
* **HashSet.**
* **HashMap.**
* **Ordered Tree Set.**
  * **Binary Search Tree.**
* **Priority Queue as a Heap** 
* **Bloom Filter**
* **Trie**
* **AVL Tree**

## Notes:
* Can we achieve O(1) time complexity for building; lookup; removal; insert; etc... (Data Structure utopia)?
* Yes? We have built the best DS!
* No?
  * Choose a different Data Structure. :joy:
