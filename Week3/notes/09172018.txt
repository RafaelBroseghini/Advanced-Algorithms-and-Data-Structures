====================

Deleting from Tree:
    - Similarities with insert.
    - Just like insert in OST. __delete
    - Return the tree after deleting the value.
    - less, right and equal control structures.


    4 cases:
        - No children. 
            - Make it none.

        - At least one children.
            - parent becomes parent of the children of target.

        - Two children.
            - get right most on left subtree.(return the value not the node)
            - get left most on right subtree.(return the value not the node)
                - delete the value.

    - In order traversal non recursively:
        - We need a stack of nodes. (references to the nodes in the tree)
        - line 66-69 erase
        - push all left nodes to the stack
        - have a while loop that tries to empty
            - pop top, print it, look in the right subtree and do a push left, root node included.
