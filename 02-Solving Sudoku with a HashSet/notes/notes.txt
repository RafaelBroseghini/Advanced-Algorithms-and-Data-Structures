Homework question: Solving Sudoku.

Steps:
split line
go through values when you see an x, it represents an unknown.

(Build matrix) - Each cell is pointing to a set with all values if it is x.

(Build groups) - rows;columns;squares. 27 groups; the first nine can be the rows.

(Squares) - for i in range(0,9, 3) (upper left corner)
                for j in range(0, 9, 3)
                group = []
                # this is where we get the nine value for a group.
                for k in range(i, i+3)
                    for m in range(j, j+3)
                group.append(matrix[i][j])

Reduce - go through the group; go back and count the number of sets that have a number exactly once in it.


RULES:
    - iterate over the group checking if set is equal to other sets. If cardinality of that set is
    equal the amounts of set with repeated values we take it out.
    USE difference_update.

Complexity of Merge Sort?
    - Why merge sort is a big O(n log n)?
         - 13 2 11 5 9 1 7 4 3 12 8 10 9 14 16 15
         - Base case is 1. Call merge sort on the two halves.
         - Two variables, one at the start of each array. And just compares the numbers, 
           merging the list together.
         - the log n part is the divide and conquer. The N part of the algorithm is merging the last
         list.

When doing quadratic probing we have to make sure that the size of table is not a power of 2
because it would lead into more primary clustering.

3 requirements:
    - __eq__
    - __hash__
    - the keys or values are immutable. They cant change once you put them in a set.
