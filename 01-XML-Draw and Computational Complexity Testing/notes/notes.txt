Magic methods - 
    Often referred to operator overloading in languages like C++

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

    When this is imported to another program it does not run main.

When a function is not a method of the class, meaning it does not take self, we must write
Object.function. We often include it inside the object because it goes along with the algorithm and we
do not provide it to outside users.
